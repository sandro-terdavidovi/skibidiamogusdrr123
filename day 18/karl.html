        Carl (or Karl) Friedrich Benz (German: [kaʁl ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈbɛnts] ⓘ; born Karl Friedrich Michael Vaillant; 25 November 1844 – 4 April 1929) was a German engine designer and automotive engineer. His Benz Patent-Motorwagen from 1885 is considered the first practical modern automobile and first car put into series production.[1] He received a patent for the motorcar in 1886, the same year he first publicly drove the Benz Patent-Motorwagen.[2]

His company Benz & Cie., based in Mannheim, was the world's first automobile plant and largest of its day.[3] In 1926, it merged with Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft to form Daimler-Benz, which produces the Mercedes-Benz among other brands.

Benz is widely regarded as "the father of the car",[4][5] as well as the "father of the automobile industry".[6]
